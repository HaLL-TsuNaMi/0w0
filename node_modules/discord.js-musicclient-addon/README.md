***
This module is a simple Node.js based music extension/bot for Discord.js projects using YouTube. This was originally an update of an older addon for newer versions of Discord.js but not serves as it's own module.   

__The commands available are: (default names)__  
* `musichelp [command]`: Displays help text for commands by this addon, or help for a specific command.
* `play <url>|<search string>`: Play audio from YouTube.
* `search <search string>`: Search's for up to 10 videos from YT.
* `skip [number]`: Skip a song or multi songs with skip [some number].
* `queue [position]`: Display the current queue.
* `pause`: Pause music playback.
* `resume`: Resume music playback.
* `remove [position]`: Remove a song from the queue by position.
* `volume`: Adjust the playback volume between 1 and 200.
* `leave`: Clears the song queue and leaves the channel.
* `clearqueue`: Clears the song queue.
* `np`: Show the current playing song.  

__Permissions:__  
* If `anyoneCanSkip` is true, anyone can skip songs in the queue.
* If `anyoneCanAdjust` is true, anyone can adjust the volume.
* If `ownerOverMember` is true, the set ID of the user (`ownerID`) will over-ride permissions from the bot.

# Installation
***  
__Pre-installation:__  
1. `npm install discord.js`  
It is recommended to have the stable branch.  

2. `ffmpeg installed` __correctly__ for your OS/env.  
Allows the bot to join voice as well as speak.  

3. `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  
Required for voice. Discord.js _prefers_ node-opus.  

__Installation:__  
* `npm install discord.js-musicbot-addon`  
If you have troubles installing, see [this link](https://github.com/DarkoPendragon/discord.js-musicbot-addon/wiki/Installation-&-Troubleshooting) or [join the discord server](https://discord.gg/FKYrX4X).

# Basic Example.

  }
}
const client = new Bot();

client.music.start({
  youtubeKey: "YouTubeAPIKeyHere" // Set the api key used for YouTube.
});

client.login("token"); // Connect the bot.
```

## Cooldown Example
```js
Music.start(client, {
  cooldown: {
    disabled: <true | false>, // TRUE or FALSE statement.
    timer: 10000,             // Time in milliseconds. 1000 = 1 second.
    exclude: ["commandName"]  // Valid commands are `play`, `remove`, `help`, `np`, `queue`, `volume`, `pause`, `resume`, `skip`, `clearqueue`, `loop`, `leave`.
  }
});
```

## Command Options.  
Commands pass a bit different. Each command follows the same format as below. Valid commands are `play`, `remove`, `help`, `np`, `queue`, `volume`, `pause`, `resume`, `skip`, `clearqueue`, `loop`, `leave`.
```js
music.start(client, {
  <command>: {
    disabled: false,                   // True/False statement.
    alt: ["name1","name2","name3"],    // Array of alt names (aliases).
    help: "Help text.",                // String of help text.
    name: "play"                       // Name of the command.
    usage: "{{prefix}}play bad memes", // Usage text. {{prefix}} will insert the bots prefix.
    exclude: false                     // Excludes the command from the help command (cannot exclude the help command).
  }
});
```


An example of a few custom options would be:  
```javascript
music.start(client, {
  botPrefix: ">",
  maxQueueSize: 0,
  ownerOverMember: true,
  ownerID: '123456789101112',
  youtubeKey: 'some-key_here',
  play: {
    alt: ["pl4y"],
    help: "Queue some shit.",
    name: "ploy"
  },
  skip: {
    alt: ["skippy"]
  }
});
```
